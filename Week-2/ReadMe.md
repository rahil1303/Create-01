Q: What is the difference between && and || in an if-condition?
A: && means both conditions must be true; || means at least one must be true.

Q: In Processing, what happens if you don‚Äôt use else after an if?
A: The program simply skips the block when the condition is false ‚Äî no alternative action happens.

Q: If two different code snippets give different results at x == 50, what concept is being tested?
A: Boundary conditions ‚Äî whether equality is included or excluded in the condition.

Q: Why is nesting two if-statements less clear than combining them with &&?
A: Because combining makes the logic explicit in one place, easier to read and less error-prone.

Q: What does map(x, 0, width, 10, 80) do?
A: It converts x from the range [0,width] into a proportional value between 10 and 80.

Q: Why use a for loop to draw circles instead of copy-pasting circle()?
A: It avoids repetition, makes the code shorter, and lets you easily change spacing or number of circles.

Q: How does changing the loop step size affect the spacing of objects?
A: A larger step gives more spacing, a smaller step places objects closer together.

Q: What does abstraction mean when writing a function like pointInRect?
A: It hides the details of checking inside a rectangle, so you can reuse it cleanly elsewhere.

Q: How does pointInRect reduce repetition?
A: Instead of rewriting mouse logic, you just call pointInRect() whenever you need that check.

Q: Why pass cx, cy, d, happy into drawEmoi instead of using globals?
A: It makes the function reusable ‚Äî you can draw multiple Emois with different properties.

Q: If you wanted two Emois on screen, what would you need to change?
A: Call drawEmoi() twice with different coordinates/diameters, no changes inside the function.

Q: What‚Äôs the purpose of constrain() when moving or resizing the Emoi?
A: To keep the Emoi inside the screen and prevent it from becoming too small or too large.

Q: How do you detect if a click was inside the Emoi‚Äôs face?
A: Check the distance from the click to the center and compare it to the radius.

Q: Why should eye and mouth sizes be derived from the Emoi‚Äôs diameter d?
A: So the Emoi scales proportionally ‚Äî it looks the same at any size.

Q: How does dragging differ from clicking in interactions?
A: Clicking is a one-time event; dragging continuously updates position or size while the mouse is held.

General (both Highlight & Emoi)

Why did you put some variables inside setup() and some outside?
A: Globals store state across frames (like position/size), locals inside setup() are only needed once for initialization.

What happens if you remove background() from draw()?
A: The old frames remain, so moving shapes leave trails on screen.

Why did you use a function instead of repeating the same code?
A: To avoid duplication, make the code reusable, and easier to update in one place.

How would you draw two creatures instead of one?
A: Just call the drawing function twice with different parameters.

Why check mouseX and mouseY in pointInRect()?
A: Because we need to compare the current mouse position against the rectangle‚Äôs bounds.

What happens if you change >= to > in your rectangle check?
A: The edges of the rectangle stop counting as ‚Äúinside.‚Äù

How does the nested for-loop build the 10√ó8 grid?
A: The outer loop goes over columns, the inner loop over rows, producing every cell in the grid.

What happens if you remove the inner loop?
A: Only a single row of cells is drawn instead of the full grid.

In Emoi, the parameter d is the diameter of the face.
If you draw the eyes and mouth with fixed values (say 20px eyes, 60px mouth), the proportions look okay for one size ‚Äî but break when you resize.

Example
// Bad: fixed values
void drawEmoi_fixed(float cx, float cy, float d) {
  circle(cx, cy, d);                // face
  circle(cx - 50, cy - 30, 20);     // left eye (always 20px)
  circle(cx + 50, cy - 30, 20);     // right eye
  arc(cx, cy + 40, 60, 40, 0, PI);  // mouth (always 60px wide)
}


If d = 200, eyes and mouth look normal.

If d = 50, the eyes cover almost the whole face!

If d = 400, the eyes look tiny, stuck in the middle.

// Good: proportional values
void drawEmoi_prop(float cx, float cy, float d) {
  circle(cx, cy, d);                   // face
  float eyeD = d * 0.125;              // 12.5% of face diameter
  float eyeOffsetX = d * 0.25;         
  float eyeOffsetY = d * 0.20;
  circle(cx - eyeOffsetX, cy - eyeOffsetY, eyeD);
  circle(cx + eyeOffsetX, cy - eyeOffsetY, eyeD);
  arc(cx, cy + d*0.25, d*0.55, d*0.35, 0, PI);
}


If d = 50, the eyes become small and close together.

If d = 400, the eyes and mouth enlarge automatically, keeping the same ‚Äúcartoon face‚Äù proportions.

üëâ So the reason: Using proportions of d makes the whole Emoi scalable. No matter the face size, it always looks like the same character, just zoomed in or out.

Why use proportions of d instead of fixed values?
A: So the Emoi scales consistently ‚Äî eyes, mouth, and stroke all resize with the face.

How do you check if a click is inside the Emoi‚Äôs face?
A: By measuring the distance from the click to the center and checking if it‚Äôs ‚â§ radius.

Why reset draggingMove and draggingResize in mouseReleased()?
A: To stop the drag action when the mouse button is released.

What happens if you don‚Äôt use constrain() when moving or resizing?
A: The Emoi can leave the screen or shrink/grow beyond limits.

How do you toggle happy/sad with a click?
A: Flip the happy boolean depending on whether the click was inside or outside the face.

What‚Äôs the difference between mousePressed, mouseClicked, and mouseDragged?
A: mousePressed: fires once when pressed; mouseClicked: fires on press+release without drag; mouseDragged: fires continuously while moving with button held.

Where would you add color changes when resizing?
A: Inside the mouseDragged() block under the resize condition, since that‚Äôs where size changes happen.
